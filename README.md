# octo-horiseon

## Description
   I used different HTML and CSS elements to make Horiseon's webpage more accessible. Images now have alt text, there is a descriptive title, the code has been left cleaner (semantic html) and the header elements are in a sequence. The different CSS properties have comments as well.
